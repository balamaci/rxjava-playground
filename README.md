## Reactive Streams
Reactive Streams is a programming concept for handling asynchronous 
data streams in a non-blocking manner while providing backpressure to stream publishers.
It has evolved into a [specification](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm) that is based on the concept of **Publisher&lt;T&gt;** and **Subscriber&lt;T&gt;**.
A **Publisher** is the source of events **T** in the stream, and a **Subscriber** is the consumer for those events.
A **Subscriber** subscribes to a **Publisher** by invoking a "factory method" in the Publisher that will push
the stream items **&lt;T&gt;** starting a new **Subscription**:

```java
public interface Publisher<T> {
    public void subscribe(Subscriber<? super T> s);
}
```

When the Subscriber is ready to start handling events, it signals this via a **request** to that **Subscription**
 
```java
public interface Subscription {
    public void request(long n); //request n items
    public void cancel();
}
```

Upon receiving this signal, the Publisher begins to invoke **Subscriber::onNext(T)** for each event **T**. 
This continues until either completion of the stream (**Subscriber::onComplete()**) 
or an error occurs during processing (**Subscriber::onError(Throwable)**).

```java
public interface Subscriber<T> {
    //signals to the Publisher to start sending events
    public void onSubscribe(Subscription s);     
    
    public void onNext(T t);
    public void onError(Throwable t);
    public void onComplete();
}
```

## Flowable and Observable
RxJava provides more types of event publishers: 
   - **Flowable** Publisher that emits 0..N elements, and then completes successfully or with an error
   - **Observable** like Flowables but without a backpressure strategy. They were introduced in RxJava 1.x
   
   - **Single** a specialized emitter that completes with a value successfully either an error.(doesn't have onComplete callback, instead onSuccess(val))
   - **Maybe** a specialized emitter that can complete with / without a value or complete with an error.
   - **Completable** a specialized emitter that just signals if it completed successfully or with an error.

Code is available at [Part01CreateFlowable.java](https://github.com/balamaci/rxjava-playground/blob/master/src/test/java/com/balamaci/rx/Part01CreateFlowable.java)

### Simple operators to create Streams
```java
Flowable<Integer> flowable = Flowable.just(1, 5, 10);
Flowable<Integer> flowable = Flowable.range(1, 10);
Flowable<String> flowable = Flowable.fromArray(new String[] {"red", "green", "blue"});
Flowable<String> flowable = Flowable.fromIterable(List.of("red", "green", "blue"));
```


### Flowable from Future

```java
CompletableFuture<String> completableFuture = CompletableFuture
            .supplyAsync(() -> { //starts a background thread the ForkJoin common pool
                    log.info("CompletableFuture work starts");  
                    Helpers.sleepMillis(100);
                    return "red";
            });

Single<String> single = Single.from(completableFuture);
single.subscribe(val -> log.info("Stream completed successfully : {}", val));
```


### Creating your own stream

We can use **Flowable.create(...)** to implement the emissions of events by calling **onNext(val)**, **onComplete()**, **onError(throwable)**

When subscribing to the Observable / Flowable with flowable.subscribe(...) the lambda code inside **create(...)** gets executed.
Flowable.subscribe(...) can take 3 handlers for each type of event - onNext, onError and onCompleted.

When using **Observable.create(...)** you need to be aware of [backpressure](#backpressure) and that Observables created with 'create' are not BackPressure aware

```java 
Observable<Integer> stream = Observable.create(subscriber -> {
    log.info("Started emitting");

    log.info("Emitting 1st");
    subscriber.onNext(1);

    log.info("Emitting 2nd");
    subscriber.onNext(2);

    subscriber.onComplete();
});

//Flowable version same Observable but with a BackpressureStrategy
//that will be discussed separately.
Flowable<Integer> stream = Flowable.create(subscriber -> {
    log.info("Started emitting");

    log.info("Emitting 1st");
    subscriber.onNext(1);

    log.info("Emitting 2nd");
    subscriber.onNext(2);

    subscriber.onComplete();
}, BackpressureStrategy.MISSING);

stream.subscribe(
       val -> log.info("Subscriber received: {}", val),
       err -> log.error("Subscriber received error", err),
       () -> log.info("Subscriber got Completed event")
);
```

### Streams are lazy 
Streams are lazy meaning that the code inside create() doesn't get executed without subscribing to the stream.
So event if we sleep for a long time inside create() method(to simulate a costly operation),
without subscribing to this Observable, the code is not executed and the method returns immediately.

```java
public void observablesAreLazy() {
    Observable<Integer> observable = Observable.create(subscriber -> {
        log.info("Started emitting but sleeping for 5 secs"); //this is not executed
        Helpers.sleepMillis(5000);
        subscriber.onNext(1);
    });
    log.info("Finished"); 
}
===========
[main] - Finished
```

### Multiple subscriptions to the same Observable / Flowable 
When subscribing to an Observable/Flowable, the create() method gets executed for each Subscriber, the events 
inside **create(..)** are re-emitted to each subscriber independently. 

So every subscriber will get the same events and will not lose any events - this behavior is named **'cold observable'**
See [Hot Publishers](#hot-publisher) to understand sharing a subscription and multicasting events.
 
```java
Observable<Integer> observable = Observable.create(subscriber -> {
   log.info("Started emitting");

   log.info("Emitting 1st event");
   subscriber.onNext(1);

   log.info("Emitting 2nd event");
   subscriber.onNext(2);

   subscriber.onComplete();
});

log.info("Subscribing 1st subscriber");
observable.subscribe(val -> log.info("First Subscriber received: {}", val));

log.info("=======================");

log.info("Subscribing 2nd subscriber");
observable.subscribe(val -> log.info("Second Subscriber received: {}", val));
```

will output

```
[main] - Subscribing 1st subscriber
[main] - Started emitting
[main] - Emitting 1st event
[main] - First Subscriber received: 1
[main] - Emitting 2nd event
[main] - First Subscriber received: 2
[main] - =======================
[main] - Subscribing 2nd subscriber
[main] - Started emitting
[main] - Emitting 1st event
[main] - Second Subscriber received: 1
[main] - Emitting 2nd event
[main] - Second Subscriber received: 2
```

## Observable / Flowable lifecycle

### Operators
Between the source Observable / Flowable and the Subscriber there can be a wide range of operators and RxJava provides 
lots of operators to chose from. Probably you are already familiar with functional operations like **filter** and **map**. 
so let's use them as example:

```java
Flowable<Integer> stream = Flowable.create(subscriber -> {
        subscriber.onNext(1);
        subscriber.onNext(2);
        ....
        subscriber.onComplete();
    }, BackpressureStrategy.MISSING);
    .filter(val -> val < 10)
    .map(val -> val * 10)
    .subscribe(val -> log.info("Received: {}", val));
```

When we call _Flowable.create()_ you might think that we're calling onNext(..), onComplete(..) on the Subscriber at the end of the chain, 
not the operators between them.

This is not true because **the operators themselves are decorators for their source** wrapping it with the operator behavior 
like an onion's layers. 
When we call **.subscribe()** at the end of the chain, **Subscription propagates through the layers back to the source,
each operator subscribing itself to it's wrapped source Observable / Flowable and so on to the original source, 
triggering it to start producing/emitting items**.

**Flowable.create** calls **---&gt; filterOperator.onNext(val)** which if val &gt; 10 calls **---&gt; 
mapOperator.onNext(val)** does val = val * 10 and calls **---&gt; subscriber.onNext(val)**. 

[Found](https://tomstechnicalblog.blogspot.ro/2015_10_01_archive.html) a nice analogy with a team of house movers, with every mover doing it's thing before passing it to the next in line 
until it reaches the final subscriber.

![Movers](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1RuGVz4-U9Q/VjT0AsfiiUI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/xWQaOwNtS7o/s1600/animation_2.gif) 
 
### Canceling subscription
Inside the create() method, we can check is there are still active subscribers to our Flowable/Observable.

There are operators that also unsubscribe from the stream so the source knows to stop producing events.  
It's a way to prevent to do extra work(like for ex. querying a datasource for entries) if no one is listening
In the following example we'd expect to have an infinite stream, but because we stop if there are no active subscribers, we stop producing events.   

**take(limit)** is a simple operator. It's role is to count the number of events and then unsubscribes from it's source 
once it received the specified amount and calls onComplete() to it's subscriber.

```java
Observable<Integer> observable = Observable.create(subscriber -> {

    int i = 1;
    while(true) {
        if(subscriber.isDisposed()) {
             break;
        }

        subscriber.onNext(i++);
        
        //registering a callback when the downstream subscriber unsubscribes
        subscriber.setCancellable(() -> log.info("Subscription canceled"));
    }
});

observable
    .take(5) //unsubscribes after the 5th event
    .subscribe(val -> log.info("Subscriber received: {}", val),
               err -> log.error("Subscriber received error", err),
               () -> log.info("Subscriber got Completed event") //The Complete event 
               //is triggered by 'take()' operator

==================
[main] - Subscriber received: *1*
[main] - Subscriber received: *2*
[main] - Subscriber received: *3*
[main] - Subscriber received: *4*
[main] - Subscriber received: *5*
[main] - Subscriber got Completed event
[main] - Subscription canceled
```


## Simple Operators
Code is available at [Part02SimpleOperators.java](https://github.com/balamaci/rxjava-playground/blob/master/src/test/java/com/balamaci/rx/Part02SimpleOperators.java)

### delay
Delay operator - the Thread.sleep of the reactive world, it's pausing each emission for a particular increment of time.

```java
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
Flowable.range(0, 2)
        .doOnNext(val -> log.info("Emitted {}", val))
        .delay(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .subscribe(tick -> log.info("Tick {}", tick),
                   (ex) -> log.info("Error emitted"),
                   () -> {
                          log.info("Completed");
                          latch.countDown();
                   });
latch.await();

==============
14:27:44 [main] - Starting
14:27:45 [main] - Emitted 0
14:27:45 [main] - Emitted 1
14:27:50 [RxComputationThreadPool-1] - Tick 0
14:27:50 [RxComputationThreadPool-1] - Tick 1
14:27:50 [RxComputationThreadPool-1] - Completed
```

The **.delay()**, **.interval()** operators uses a [Scheduler](#schedulers) by default which is why we see it executing
on a different thread _RxComputationThreadPool-1_ which actually means it's running the operators and the subscribe operations 
on another thread and so the test method will terminate before we see the text from the log unless we wait for the completion of the stream. 
This is the role of the **CountdownLatch**.

### interval
Periodically emits a number starting from 0 and then increasing the value on each emission.

```java
log.info("Starting");
Flowable.interval(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
       .take(4)
       .subscribe(tick -> log.info("Subscriber received {}", tick),
                  (ex) -> log.info("Error emitted"),
                  () -> log.info("Subscriber got Completed event"));

==========
12:17:56 [main] - Starting
12:18:01 [RxComputationThreadPool-1] - Subscriber received: 0
12:18:06 [RxComputationThreadPool-1] - Subscriber received: 1
12:18:11 [RxComputationThreadPool-1] - Subscriber received: 2
12:18:16 [RxComputationThreadPool-1] - Subscriber received: 3
12:18:21 [RxComputationThreadPool-1] - Subscriber received: 4
12:18:21 [RxComputationThreadPool-1] - Subscriber got Completed event
```



### scan
Takes an **initial value** and a **function(accumulator, currentValue)**. It goes through the events
sequence and combines the current event value with the previous result(accumulator) emitting downstream the function's
result for each event(the initial value is used for the first event)

```java
Flowable<Integer> numbers = 
                Flowable.just(3, 5, -2, 9)
                    .scan(0, (totalSoFar, currentValue) -> {
                               log.info("TotalSoFar={}, currentValue={}", 
                                            totalSoFar, currentValue);
                               return totalSoFar + currentValue;
                    });

=============
16:09:17 [main] - Subscriber received: 0
16:09:17 [main] - TotalSoFar=0, currentValue=3
16:09:17 [main] - Subscriber received: 3
16:09:17 [main] - TotalSoFar=3, currentValue=5
16:09:17 [main] - Subscriber received: 8
16:09:17 [main] - TotalSoFar=8, currentValue=-2
16:09:17 [main] - Subscriber received: 6
16:09:17 [main] - TotalSoFar=6, currentValue=9
16:09:17 [main] - Subscriber received: 15
16:09:17 [main] - Subscriber got Completed event
```

### reduce
reduce operator acts like the scan operator but it only passes downstream the final result 
(doesn't pass the intermediate results downstream) so the subscriber receives just one event

```java
Flowable<Integer> numbers = Flowable.just(3, 5, -2, 9)
                            .reduce(0, (totalSoFar, val) -> {
                                         log.info("totalSoFar={}, emitted={}",
                                                        totalSoFar, val);
                                         return totalSoFar + val;
                            });
                            
=============                            
17:08:29 [main] - totalSoFar=0, emitted=3
17:08:29 [main] - totalSoFar=3, emitted=5
17:08:29 [main] - totalSoFar=8, emitted=-2
17:08:29 [main] - totalSoFar=6, emitted=9
17:08:29 [main] - Subscriber received: 15
17:08:29 [main] - Subscriber got Completed event
```

### collect
collect operator acts similar to the _reduce_ operator, but while the _reduce_ operator uses a reduce function
which returns a value, the _collect_ operator takes a container supplier and a function which doesn't return
anything(a consumer). The mutable container is passed for every event and thus you get a chance to modify it
in this collect consumer function.

```java
Flowable<List<Integer>> numbers = Flowable.just(3, 5, -2, 9)
                                        .collect(ArrayList::new, (container, value) -> {
                                            log.info("Adding {} to container", value);
                                            container.add(value);
                                            //notice we don't need to return anything
                                        });
=========
17:40:18 [main] - Adding 3 to container
17:40:18 [main] - Adding 5 to container
17:40:18 [main] - Adding -2 to container
17:40:18 [main] - Adding 9 to container
17:40:18 [main] - Subscriber received: [3, 5, -2, 9]
17:40:18 [main] - Subscriber got Completed event
```

because the usecase to store to a List container is so common, there is a **.toList()** operator that is just a collector adding to a List. 

### defer
An easy way to switch from a blocking method to a reactive Single/Flowable is to use **.defer(() -> blockingOp())**.

Simply using **Flowable.just(blockingOp())** would still block, as Java needs to resolve the parameter when invoking
**Flux.just(param)** method, so _blockingOp()_ method would still be invoked(and block).

```java
//NOT OK
Flowable<String> flowableBlocked = Flowable.just((blockingOp())); //blocks on this line
```
    
In order to get around this problem, we can use **Flowable.defer(() -> blockingOp())** and wrap the _blockingOp()_ call inside a lambda which 
will be invoked lazy **at subscribe time**.

```java
Flowable<String> stream = Flowable.defer(() -> Flowable.just(blockingOperation())); 
stream.subscribe(val -> log.info("Val " + val)); //only now the code inside defer() is executed
```


## Merging Streams
Operators for working with multiple streams
Code at [Part03MergingStreams.java](https://github.com/balamaci/rxjava-playground/blob/master/src/test/java/com/balamaci/rx/Part03MergingStreams.java)

### zip
Zip operator operates sort of like a zipper in the sense that it takes an event from one stream and waits
for an event from another other stream. Once an event for the other stream arrives, it uses the zip function
to merge the two events.

This is an useful scenario when for example you want to make requests to remote services in parallel and
wait for both responses before continuing. It also takes a function which will produce the combined result
of the zipped streams once each has emitted a value.

![Zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/projectreactor.io/master/src/main/static/assets/img/marble/zip.png)

Zip operator besides the streams to zip, also takes as parameter a function which will produce the 
combined result of the zipped streams once each stream emitted its value

```java
Single<Boolean> isUserBlockedStream = 
                    Single.fromFuture(CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
                            Helpers.sleepMillis(200);
                            return Boolean.FALSE;
                    }));

Single<Integer> userCreditScoreStream = 
                    Single.fromFuture(CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
                            Helpers.sleepMillis(2300);
                            return 5;
                    }));

Single<Pair<Boolean, Integer>> userCheckStream = Single.zip(isUserBlockedStream, userCreditScoreStream, 
                      (blocked, creditScore) -> new Pair<Boolean, Integer>(blocked, creditScore));

userCheckStream.subscribe(pair -> log.info("Received " + pair));
```

Even if the 'isUserBlockedStream' finishes after 200ms, 'userCreditScoreStream' is slow at 2.3secs, 
the 'zip' method applies the combining function(new Pair(x,y)) after it received both values and passes it 
to the subscriber.


Another good example of 'zip' is to slow down a stream by another basically **implementing a periodic emitter of events**:

```java  
Flowable<String> colors = Flowable.just("red", "green", "blue");
Flowable<Long> timer = Flowable.interval(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

Flowable<String> periodicEmitter = Flowable.zip(colors, timer, (key, val) -> key);
```

Since the zip operator needs a pair of events, the slow stream will work like a timer by periodically emitting 
with zip setting the pace of emissions downstream every 2 seconds.

**Zip is not limited to just two streams**, it can merge 2,3,4,.. streams and wait for groups of 2,3,4 'pairs' of 
events which it combines with the zip function and sends downstream.

### merge
Merge operator combines one or more stream and passes events downstream as soon as they appear.

![merge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/projectreactor.io/master/src/main/static/assets/img/marble/merge.png)

```
Flowable<String> colors = periodicEmitter("red", "green", "blue", 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

Flowable<Long> numbers = Flowable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .take(5);
                
//notice we can't say Flowable<String> or Flowable<Long> as the return stream o the merge operator since 
//it can emit either a color or number.                  
Flowable flowable = Flowable.merge(colors, numbers);                

============
21:32:15 - Subscriber received: 0
21:32:16 - Subscriber received: red
21:32:16 - Subscriber received: 1
21:32:17 - Subscriber received: 2
21:32:18 - Subscriber received: green
21:32:18 - Subscriber received: 3
21:32:19 - Subscriber received: 4
21:32:20 - Subscriber received: blue
```

### concat
Concat operator appends another streams at the end of another
![concat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/projectreactor.io/master/src/main/static/assets/img/marble/concat.png)

```java
Flowable<String> colors = periodicEmitter("red", "green", "blue", 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

Flowable<Long> numbers = Flowable.interval(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .take(4);

Flowable events = Flowable.concat(colors, numbers);

==========
22:48:23 - Subscriber received: red
22:48:25 - Subscriber received: green
22:48:27 - Subscriber received: blue
22:48:28 - Subscriber received: 0
22:48:29 - Subscriber received: 1
22:48:30 - Subscriber received: 2
22:48:31 - Subscriber received: 3
```

Even if the 'numbers' streams should start early, the 'colors' stream emits fully its events
before we see any 'numbers'.
This is because 'numbers' stream is actually subscribed only after the 'colors' complete.
Should the second stream be a 'hot' emitter, its events would be lost until the first one finishes
and the seconds stream is subscribed.

## Hot Publishers
We've seen that with 'cold publishers', whenever a subscriber subscribes, each subscriber will get
it's version of emitted values independently, the exact set of data indifferently when they subscribe.
But cold publishers only produce data when the subscribers subscribes, however there are cases where 
the events happen independently from the consumers regardless if someone is 
listening or not and we don't have control to request more. So you could say we have 'cold publishers' for pull
scenarios and 'hot publishers' which push.

### Subjects
Subjects are one way to handle hot observables. Subjects keep reference to their subscribers and allow 'multicasting' 
an event to them.

```java
for (Disposable<T> s : subscribers.get()) {
    s.onNext(t);
}
```

Subjects besides being traditional Observables you can use the same operators and subscribe to them,
are also an **Observer**(interface like **Subscriber** from [reactive-streams](#reactive-streams), implementing the 3 methods **onNext, onError, onComplete**), 
meaning you can invoke subject.onNext(value) from different parts in the code,
which means that you publish events which the Subject will pass on to their subscribers.

```java
Subject<Integer> subject = ReplaySubject.create()
                     .map(...);
                     .subscribe(); //

...
subject.onNext(val);
...
subject.onNext(val2);
```
remember for 
```java
Observable.create(subscriber -> {
      subscriber.onNext(val);
})
```

### ReplaySubject
ReplaySubject keeps a buffer of events that it 'replays' to each new subscriber, first he receives a batch of missed 
and only later events in real-time.

```java
Subject<Integer> subject = ReplaySubject.createWithSize(50);

log.info("Pushing 0");
subject.onNext(0);
log.info("Pushing 1");
subject.onNext(1);

log.info("Subscribing 1st");

### ConnectableObservable / ConnectableFlowable and resource sharing
There are cases when we want to share a single subscription between subscribers, meaning while the code that executes
on subscribing should be executed once, the events should be published to all subscribers.     

For ex. when we want to share a connection between multiple Observables / Flowables. 
Using a plain Observable would just reexecute the code inside _.create()_ and opening / closing a new connection for each 
new subscriber when it subscribes / cancels its subscription.

**ConnectableObservable** are a special kind of **Observable**. No matter how many Subscribers subscribe to ConnectableObservable, 
it opens just one subscription to the Observable from which it was created.

Anyone who subscribes to **ConnectableObservable** is placed in a set of Subscribers(it doesn't trigger
the _.create()_ code a normal Observable would when .subscribe() is called). A **.connect()** method is available for ConnectableObservable.
**As long as connect() is not called, these Subscribers are put on hold, they never directly subscribe to upstream Observable**

```java
ConnectableObservable<Integer> connectableObservable = 
                                  Observable.<Integer>create(subscriber -> {
        log.info("Inside create()");

     /* A JMS connection listener example
         Just an example of a costly operation that is better to be shared **/

     /* Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();
        Session session = connection.createSession(true, AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
        MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(orders);
        consumer.setMessageListener(subscriber::onNext); */

        subscriber.setCancellable(() -> log.info("Subscription cancelled"));

        log.info("Emitting 1");
        subscriber.onNext(1);

        log.info("Emitting 2");
        subscriber.onNext(2);

        subscriber.onComplete();
}).publish();

connectableObservable
       .take(1)
       .subscribe((val) -> log.info("Subscriber1 received: {}", val), 
                    logError(), logComplete());

connectableObservable
       .subscribe((val) -> log.info("Subscriber2 received: {}", val), 
                    logError(), logComplete());

log.info("Now connecting to the ConnectableObservable");
connectableObservable.connect();

===================

```

### share() operator 
Another operator of the ConnectableObservable **.refCount()** allows to do away with having to manually call **.connect()**,
instead it invokes the .create() code when the first Subscriber subscribes while sharing this single subscription with subsequent Subscribers.
This means that **.refCount()** basically keeps a count of references of it's subscribers and subscribes to upstream Observable
(executes the code inside .create() just for the first subscriber), but multicasts the same event to each active subscriber. 
When the last subscriber unsubscribes, the ref counter goes from 1 to 0 and triggers any unsubscribe callback associated.   
If another Subscriber subscribes after that, counter goes from 0 to 1 and the process starts over again. 

```java
ConnectableObservable<Integer> connectableStream = Observable.<Integer>create(subscriber -> {
   log.info("Inside create()");
   
   //Simulated MessageListener emits periodically every 500 milliseconds
   ResourceConnectionHandler resourceConnectionHandler = new ResourceConnectionHandler() {
        @Override
        public void onMessage(Integer message) {
             log.info("Emitting {}", message);
             subscriber.onNext(message);
        }
   };
   resourceConnectionHandler.openConnection();

   //when the last subscriber unsubscribes it will invoke disconnect on the resourceConnectionHandler
   subscriber.setCancellable(resourceConnectionHandler::disconnect);
}).publish(); 

//publish().refCount() have been joined together in the .share() operator
Observable<Integer> observable = connectableObservable.refCount();

CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(2);
connectableStream
      .take(5)
      .subscribe((val) -> log.info("Subscriber1 received: {}", val), 
                    logError(), logComplete(latch));

Helpers.sleepMillis(1000);

log.info("Subscribing 2nd");
//we're not seing the code inside .create() reexecuted
connectableStream
      .take(2)
      .subscribe((val) -> log.info("Subscriber2 received: {}", val), 
                    logError(), logComplete(latch));

//waiting for the streams to complete
Helpers.wait(latch);

//subscribing another after previous Subscribers unsubscribed
latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
log.info("Subscribing 3rd");
observable
     .take(1)
     .subscribe((val) -> log.info("Subscriber3 received: {}", val), logError(), logComplete(latch));

```
The **share()** operator of Observable / Flowable is an operator which basically does **publish().refCount()**. 

## Schedulers
RxJava provides some high level concepts for concurrent execution, like ExecutorService we're not dealing
with the low level constructs like creating the Threads ourselves. Instead we're using a **Scheduler** which create
Workers who are responsible for scheduling and running code. By default RxJava will not introduce concurrency 
and will run the operations on the subscription thread.

There are two methods through which we can introduce Schedulers into our chain of operations:

   - **subscribeOn** allows to specify which Scheduler invokes the code contained in the lambda code for Observable.create()
   - **observeOn** allows control to which Scheduler executes the code in the downstream operators

RxJava provides some general use Schedulers:
 
  - **Schedulers.computation()** - to be used for CPU intensive tasks. A threadpool. Should not be used for tasks involving blocking IO.
  - **Schedulers.io()** - to be used for IO bound tasks  
  - **Schedulers.from(Executor)** - custom ExecutorService
  - **Schedulers.newThread()** - always creates a new thread when a worker is needed. Since it's not thread pooled and 
  always creates a new thread instead of reusing one, this scheduler is not very useful 
 
Although we said by default RxJava doesn't introduce concurrency. Notice how we are not doing anything on another thread
than the subscribing thread 'main' and the Test doesn't end until the complete event is processed:
```java
@Test
public void byDefaultRxJavaDoesntIntroduceConcurrency() {
   log.info("Starting");

   Observable.<Integer>create(subscriber -> {
        log.info("Someone subscribed");
        subscriber.onNext(1);
        subscriber.onNext(2);

        subscriber.onComplete();
   })
   .map(val -> {
         log.info("Mapping {}", val);
         //what if we do some Thread.sleep here 
         //Thread.sleep(2000);
         return val * 10;
   })
   .subscribe(logNext());
}

11:23:50 [main] INFO BaseTestObservables - Mapping 2
11:23:50 [main] INFO BaseTestObservables - Subscriber received: 20
```
now let's enable that _Thread.sleep(2000)_ above.
```
11:42:12 [main] INFO BaseTestObservables - Starting
11:42:12 [main] INFO BaseTestObservables - Someone subscribed
11:42:12 [main] INFO BaseTestObservables - Mapping 1
11:42:14 [main] INFO BaseTestObservables - Subscriber received: 10
11:42:14 [main] INFO BaseTestObservables - Mapping 2
11:42:16 [main] INFO BaseTestObservables - Subscriber received: 20
``` 
as expected nothing changes, just that we receive the events in the Subscriber delayed by 2 secs.
To prevent this, lots of RxJava operators that involve waiting as **delay**,**interval**, **zip** run on a Scheduler, otherwise they would just block the subscribing thread. 
By default **Schedulers.computation()** is used, but the Scheduler can be passed as a parameter to those methods.

Ok so how can we provide different threads to run the different parts of the code.

### subscribeOn
As stated above **subscribeOn** allows to specify on which Scheduler thread the subscribtion is made - which thread invokes the code contained in the lambda for Observable.create() -
(it's **not** abouth the thread for where the code in **.subscribe((val) -> {...})** gets executed). 
Since the operators are lazy and nothing happens until subscription, where the **.subscribeOn()** is called doesn't make any difference.
Also calling **.subscribeOn()** multiple times at different positions doesn't have any effect, only the first **.subscribeOn()** Scheduler is considered.   


```java
@Test
public void testSubscribeOn() {
   log.info("Starting");

   Observable<Integer> observable = Observable.create(subscriber -> { 
       //code that will execute inside the IO ThreadPool
       log.info("Starting slow network op");
       Helpers.sleepMillis(2000);

       log.info("Emitting 1st");
       subscriber.onNext(1);

       subscriber.onComplete();
   });

   observable = observable
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) //Specify execution on the IO Scheduler
                .map(val -> {
                    int newValue = val * 10;
                    log.info("Mapping {} to {}", val, newValue);
                    return newValue;
                });

   /** Since we are switching the subscription thread we now need to wait 
   * for the Thread to complete so again we are using the CountDownLatch "trick" to do it.
   **/    
   CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
   
   observable.subscribe(
                logNext(),
                logError(latch),
                logComplete(latch)
   );
   
   Helpers.wait(latch);
}

===============

13:16:33 [RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] INFO BaseTestObservables - Subscriber got Completed event
```
Notice how the code and also the flow down the operators like **.map()** is switched to this new Scheduler that was specified. 


### observeOn
**observeOn** allows control to which Scheduler executes the code in the downstream operators.
So by using **observeOn()** we changed the Scheduler for the **map** operator, but notice how the last **.observeOn(Schedulers.newThread())** 
we also influence the code received by the subscriber, while **.subscribeOn()** just had a part on the code executed before we changed with **.observeOn()**  

```java
log.info("Starting");

Observable<Integer> observable = 
        Observable.create(subscriber -> { 
                    //code that will execute inside the IO Scheduler
             log.info("Emitting 1st");
             subscriber.onNext(1);
 
             log.info("Emitting 2nd");
             subscriber.onNext(2);
 
             subscriber.onComplete();
        })
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
        .observeOn(Schedulers.computation())
        .map(val -> {
              int newValue = val * 10;
              log.info("Mapping {} to {}", val, newValue);
              return newValue;
        })
        .observeOn(Schedulers.newThread());

   CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
   
   observable.subscribe(
                logNext(),
                logError(latch),
                logComplete(latch)
   );
   
   Helpers.wait(latch);

### back to blocking world 
How about when we want to switch back to a blocking flow. We saw above how we need to explicitly use latching
to keep the [main] thread. Say we're incrementally switching from legacy code and we have a Service method
**Collection\<String\> findUsers()** inside this method we can still be reactive but to the caller of the method we
still need to block until we get all the elements of the Collection.
Using **blockingIterable** will block our Test thread till the Flow completes, waiting
for the events to be emitted(we're sleeping just to show it's not completing by chance).

```java
log.info("Starting");

Flowable<String> flowable = simpleFlowable()
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.computation())
                .map(val -> {
                    String newValue = "^^" + val + "^^";
                    log.info("Mapping new val {}", newValue);
                    Helpers.sleepMillis(500);
                    return newValue;
                });

Iterable<String> iterable = flowable.blockingIterable(); //this call will block until
//the stream completes
iterable.forEach(val -> log.info("Received {}", val));

==========================
17:48:13 [RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] - Started emitting
17:48:13 [RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] - Emitting 1st
17:48:13 [RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] - Mapping new val ^^1^^
17:48:14 [RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] - Emitting 2nd
17:48:14 [main] - Received ^^1^^
17:48:14 [RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] - Mapping new val ^^2^^
17:48:14 [main] - Received ^^2^^
17:48:14 [main] - Finished blockingIterable
```
we can see the events being received back on the **\[main\]** thread.

```java
    //block until the stream completes or throws an error.
    flowable.blockingSubscribe(val -> log.info("Subscriber received {}", val));
```


## Flatmap operator
The flatMap operator is so important and has so many different uses it deserves it's own category to explain it.
Code at [Part06FlatMapOperator.java](https://github.com/balamaci/rxjava-playground/blob/master/src/test/java/com/balamaci/rx/Part06FlatMapOperator.java)

I like to think of it as a sort of **fork-join** operation because what flatMap does is it takes individual stream items
and maps each of them to an Observable(so it creates new Streams from each object) and then 'flattens' the events from 
these Streams back as coming from a single stream.

Why this looks like fork-join because for each element you can fork some jobs that keeps emitting results,
and these results are emitted back as elements to the subscribers downstream

**Rules of thumb** to consider before getting comfortable with flatMap: 
   
   - When you have an 'item' **T** and a method **T -&lt; Flowable&lt;X&gt;**, you need flatMap. Most common example is when you want 
   to make a remote call that returns an Observable / Flowable . For ex if you have a stream of customerIds, and downstream you
    want to work with actual Customer objects:    
   
   - When you have Observable&lt;Observable&lt;T&gt;&gt;(aka stream of streams) you probably need flatMap. Because flatMap means you are subscribing
   to each substream.

We use a simulated remote call that returns asynchronous events. This is a most common scenario to make a remote call for each stream element, 
(although in non reactive world we're more likely familiar with remote operations returning Lists **T -&gt; List&lt;X&gt;**).
Our simulated remote operation produces as many events as the length of the color string received as parameter every 200ms, 
so for example **red : red0, red1, red2** 

```java
private Flowable<String> simulateRemoteOperation(String color) {
  return Flowable.intervalRange(1, color.length(), 0, 200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
             .map(iteration -> color + iteration);
}
```

If we have a stream of color names:

```java
Flowable<String> colors = Flowable.just("orange", "red", "green")
```

to invoke the remote operation: 

```java
Flowable<String> colors = Flowable.just("orange", "red", "green")
         .flatMap(colorName -> simulatedRemoteOperation(colorName));

colors.subscribe(val -> log.info("Subscriber received: {}", val));         

====
16:44:15 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange0
16:44:15 [Thread-2]- Subscriber received: green0
16:44:15 [Thread-1]- Subscriber received: red0
16:44:15 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange1
16:44:15 [Thread-2]- Subscriber received: green1
16:44:15 [Thread-1]- Subscriber received: red1
16:44:15 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange2
16:44:15 [Thread-2]- Subscriber received: green2
16:44:15 [Thread-1]- Subscriber received: red2
16:44:15 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange3
16:44:15 [Thread-2]- Subscriber received: green3
16:44:16 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange4
16:44:16 [Thread-2]- Subscriber received: green4
16:44:16 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange5
```

Notice how the results are coming intertwined(mixed) and it might not be as you expected it.This is because flatMap actually subscribes to it's inner Observables 
returned from 'simulateRemoteOperation'. You can specify the **concurrency level of flatMap** as a parameter. Meaning 
you can say how many of the substreams should be subscribed "concurrently" - after **onComplete** is triggered on the substreams,
a new substream is subscribed-.

By setting the concurrency to **1** we don't subscribe to other substreams until the current one finishes:

```
Flowable<String> colors = Flowable.just("orange", "red", "green")
                     .flatMap(val -> simulateRemoteOperation(val), 1); //

```

Notice now there is a sequence from each color before the next one appears

```
17:15:24 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange0
17:15:24 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange1
17:15:25 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange2
17:15:25 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange3
17:15:25 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange4
17:15:25 [Thread-0]- Subscriber received: orange5
17:15:25 [Thread-1]- Subscriber received: red0
17:15:26 [Thread-1]- Subscriber received: red1
17:15:26 [Thread-1]- Subscriber received: red2
17:15:26 [Thread-2]- Subscriber received: green0
17:15:26 [Thread-2]- Subscriber received: green1
17:15:26 [Thread-2]- Subscriber received: green2
17:15:27 [Thread-2]- Subscriber received: green3
17:15:27 [Thread-2]- Subscriber received: green4
```

There is actually an operator which is basically this **flatMap with 1 concurrency called concatMap**.


Inside the flatMap we can operate on the substream with the same stream operators

```java
Observable<Pair<String, Integer>> colorsCounted = colors
    .flatMap(colorName -> {
               Observable<Long> timer = Observable.interval(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

               return simulateRemoteOperation(colorName) // <- Still a stream
                              .zipWith(timer, (val, timerVal) -> val)
                              .count()
                              .map(counter -> new Pair<>(colorName, counter));
               }
    );
```

We can also use **switchIfEmpty** to provide some values when the original Publisher doesn't return anything, just completes.
```java
Flowable<String> colors = Flowable.just("red", "", "blue")
                            .flatMap(colorName -> simulateRemoteOperation(colorName)
                                                    .switchIfEmpty(Flowable.just("NONE")));

13:11:02  Subscriber received: red0
13:11:02  Subscriber received: red1
13:11:02  Subscriber received: red2
13:11:03  Subscriber received: NONE
13:11:03  Subscriber received: blue0
13:11:03  Subscriber received: blue1
13:11:03  Subscriber received: blue2
13:11:03  Subscriber received: blue3
13:11:03  Subscriber got Completed event
```

**flatMapIterable** is just an easy way to pass each of the elements of a collection
as a stream
```
Flowable<String> colors = Flowable.just(1)
                .flatMapIterable(it -> generateColors());


private List<String> generateColors() {
   return Arrays.asList("red", "green", "blue");
}

```

**switchMap** operator also prevents inter-leavings as only one of stream is subscribed at a time, 
but this is controlled from upstream. If a new value comes from upstream, the current subscribed inner-stream 
 gets canceled and a new subscription is made for the new value.
The current stream will remain subscribed as long as there are no new values from upstream. 
```java   
Flowable<String> colors = Flowable.interval(0,400, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
         .zipWith(Arrays.asList("EUR", "USD", "GBP"), (it, currency) -> currency)
         .doOnNext(ev -> log.info("Emitting {}", ev))
         .switchMap(currency -> simulateRemoteOperation(currency)
                      .doOnSubscribe((subscription) -> log.info("Subscribed new"))
                      .doOnCancel(() -> log.info("Unsubscribed {}", currency))
         );
```

## Error handling
Code at [Part08ErrorHandling.java](https://github.com/balamaci/rxjava-playground/blob/master/src/test/java/com/balamaci/rx/Part08ErrorHandling.java)

Exceptions are for exceptional situations.
The Reactive Streams specification says that **exceptions are terminal operations**. 
That means in case an error occurs, it triggers an unsubscription upstream and the error travels downstream to the Subscriber, invoking the 'onError' handler:

```java
Observable<String> colors = Observable.just("green", "blue", "red", "yellow")
       .map(color -> {
              if ("red".equals(color)) {
                        throw new RuntimeException("Encountered red");
              }
              return color + "*";
       })
       .map(val -> val + "XXX");

colors.subscribe(
         val -> log.info("Subscriber received: {}", val),
         exception -> log.error("Subscriber received error '{}'", exception.getMessage()),
         () -> log.info("Subscriber completed")
);
```

returns:
```
23:30:17 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: green*XXX
23:30:17 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: blue*XXX
23:30:17 [main] ERROR - Subscriber received error 'Encountered red'
```
After the map() operator encounters an error it unsubscribes(cancels the subscription) from upstream
(therefore 'yellow' is not even emitted). The error travels downstream and triggers the error handler in the Subscriber.


There are operators to deal with error flow control:
 
### onErrorReturn

The 'onErrorReturn' operator replaces an exception with a value:

```java
Flowable<Integer> numbers = Flowable.just("1", "3", "a", "4", "5", "c")
                            .doOnCancel(() -> log.info("Subscription canceled"))
                            .map(Integer::parseInt) 
                            .onErrorReturn(0);      
subscribeWithLog(numbers);

======================
Subscriber received: 1
Subscriber received: 3
Subscription canceled
Subscriber received: 0
Subscriber got Completed event
```

Notice though how **it didn't prevent map() operator from unsubscribing from the Flowable**, but it did 
trigger the normal **onNext** callback instead of **onError** in the subscriber.


Let's introduce a more realcase scenario of a simulated remote request that fails whenever it's invoked
with "red" and "black" color parameters otherwise just add some \*s.


```java
private Observable<String> simulateRemoteOperation(String color) {
    return Observable.<String>create(subscriber -> {
         if ("red".equals(color)) {
              log.info("Emitting RuntimeException for {}", color);
              throw new RuntimeException("Color red raises exception");
         }
         if ("black".equals(color)) {
              log.info("Emitting IllegalArgumentException for {}", color);
              throw new IllegalArgumentException("Black is not a color");
         }

         String value = "**" + color + "**";

         log.info("Emitting {}", value);
         subscriber.onNext(value);
         subscriber.onCompleted();
    });
}

Flowable<String> colors = Flowable.just("green", "blue", "red", "white", "blue")
                .flatMap(color -> simulateRemoteOperation(color))
                .onErrorReturn(throwable -> "-blank-");
                
subscribeWithLog(colors);

============

22:15:51 [main] INFO - Emitting **green**
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: **green**
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Emitting **blue**
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: **blue**
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Emitting RuntimeException for red
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: -blank-
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Subscriber got Completed event
```
flatMap encounters an error when it subscribes to 'red' substreams and thus still unsubscribe from 'colors' 
stream and the remaining colors are not longer emitted


```java
Flowable<String> colors = Flowable.just("green", "blue", "red", "white", "blue")
                .flatMap(color -> simulateRemoteOperation(color)
                                    .onErrorReturn(throwable -> "-blank-")
                );
```
onErrorReturn() is applied to the flatMap substream and thus translates the exception to a value and so flatMap 
continues on with the other colors after red

returns:
```
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Emitting **green**
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: **green**
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Emitting **blue**
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: **blue**
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Emitting RuntimeException for red
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: -blank-
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Emitting **white**
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: **white**
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Emitting **blue**
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: **blue**
22:15:51 [main] INFO - Subscriber got Completed event
```

### onErrorResumeNext
onErrorResumeNext() returns a stream instead of an exception, useful for example to invoke a fallback 
method that returns an alternate Stream

```java
Observable<String> colors = Observable.just("green", "blue", "red", "white", "blue")
     .flatMap(color -> simulateRemoteOperation(color)
                        .onErrorResumeNext(th -> {
                            if (th instanceof IllegalArgumentException) {
                                return Observable.error(new RuntimeException("Fatal, wrong arguments"));
                            }
                            return fallbackRemoteOperation();
                        })
     );

private Observable<String> fallbackRemoteOperation() {
        return Observable.just("blank");
}
```



## Retrying

### timeout()
Timeout operator raises exception when there are no events incoming before it's predecessor in the specified time limit.

### retry()
**retry()** - resubscribes in case of exception to the Observable

```java
Flowable<String> colors = Flowable.just("red", "blue", "green", "yellow")
       .concatMap(color -> delayedByLengthEmitter(TimeUnit.SECONDS, color) 
                             //if there are no events flowing in the timeframe   
                             .timeout(6, TimeUnit.SECONDS)  
                             .retry(2)
                             .onErrorResumeNext(Observable.just("blank"))
       );

subscribeWithLog(colors.toBlocking());
```

returns
```
12:40:16 [main] INFO - Received red delaying for 3 
12:40:19 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: red
12:40:19 [RxComputationScheduler-2] INFO - Received blue delaying for 4 
12:40:23 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: blue
12:40:23 [RxComputationScheduler-4] INFO - Received green delaying for 5 
12:40:28 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: green
12:40:28 [RxComputationScheduler-6] INFO - Received yellow delaying for 6 
12:40:34 [RxComputationScheduler-7] INFO - Received yellow delaying for 6 
12:40:40 [RxComputationScheduler-1] INFO - Received yellow delaying for 6 
12:40:46 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: blank
12:40:46 [main] INFO - Subscriber got Completed event
```

When you want to retry considering the thrown exception type:

```java
Observable<String> colors = Observable.just("blue", "red", "black", "yellow")
         .flatMap(colorName -> simulateRemoteOperation(colorName)
                .retry((retryAttempt, exception) -> {
                           if (exception instanceof IllegalArgumentException) {
                               log.error("{} encountered non retry exception ", colorName);
                               return false;
                           }
                           log.info("Retry attempt {} for {}", retryAttempt, colorName);
                           return retryAttempt <= 2;
                })
                .onErrorResumeNext(Observable.just("generic color"))
         );
```

```
13:21:37 [main] INFO - Emitting **blue**
13:21:37 [main] INFO - Emitting RuntimeException for red
13:21:37 [main] INFO - Retry attempt 1 for red
13:21:37 [main] INFO - Emitting RuntimeException for red
13:21:37 [main] INFO - Retry attempt 2 for red
13:21:37 [main] INFO - Emitting RuntimeException for red

13:21:37 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: **yellow**
13:21:37 [main] INFO - Subscriber got Completed event
```

### retryWhen
A more complex retry logic like implementing a backoff strategy in case of exception
This can be obtained with **retryWhen**(exceptionObservable -> Observable)

retryWhen resubscribes when an event from an Observable is emitted. It receives as parameter an exception stream
     
we zip the exceptionsStream with a .range() stream to obtain the number of retries,
however we want to wait a little before retrying so in the zip function we return a delayed event - .timer()

The delay also needs to be subscribed to be effected so we also flatMap

```java
Observable<String> colors = Observable.just("blue", "green", "red", "black", "yellow");

colors.flatMap(colorName -> 
                   simulateRemoteOperation(colorName)
                      .retryWhen(exceptionStream -> exceptionStream
                                    .zipWith(Observable.range(1, 3), (exc, attempts) -> {
                                        //don't retry for IllegalArgumentException
                                        if(exc instanceof IllegalArgumentException) {
                                             return Observable.error(exc);
                                        }

                                        if(attempts < 3) {
                                             return Observable.timer(2 * attempts, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
                                        }
                                        return Observable.error(exc);
                                    })
                                    .flatMap(val -> val)
                      )
                      .onErrorResumeNext(Observable.just("generic color")
                   )
            );
```

```
15:20:23 [main] INFO - Emitting **blue**
15:20:23 [main] INFO - Emitting **green**
15:20:23 [main] INFO - Emitting RuntimeException for red
15:20:23 [main] INFO - Emitting IllegalArgumentException for black
15:20:23 [main] INFO - Emitting **yellow**
15:20:23 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: **blue**
15:20:23 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: **green**

15:20:29 [main] INFO - Subscriber received: generic color
15:20:29 [main] INFO - Subscriber got Completed event
```

**retryWhen vs repeatWhen** 
With similar names it worth noting the difference.
 
   - repeat() resubscribes when it receives onCompleted().
   - retry() resubscribes when it receives onError().
   
Example using repeatWhen() to implement periodic polling
```java
remoteOperation.repeatWhen(completed -> completed
                                     .delay(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS))                                                       
```
   
## Backpressure

It can be the case of a slow consumer that cannot keep up with the producer that is producing too many events
that the subscriber cannot process. 

Backpressure relates to a feedback mechanism through which the subscriber can signal to the producer how much data 
it can consume and so to produce only that amount.

The [reactive-streams](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm) section above we saw that besides the 
**onNext, onError** and **onComplete** handlers, the Subscriber
has an **onSubscribe(Subscription)**, Subscription through which it can signal upstream it's ready to receive a number 
of items and after it processes the items request another batch.


```java
public interface Subscriber<T> {
    //signals to the Publisher to start sending events
    public void onSubscribe(Subscription s);     
    
    public void onNext(T t);
    public void onError(Throwable t);
    public void onComplete();
}
```

The methods exposed by **Subscription** through which the subscriber comunicates with the upstream:

```java
public interface Subscription {
    public void request(long n); //request n items
    public void cancel();
}
```

So in theory the Subscriber can prevent being overloaded by requesting an initial number of items. The Publisher would
send those items downstream and not produce any more, until the Subscriber would request more. We say in theory because
until now we did not see a custom **onSubscribe(Subscription)** request being implemented. This is because if not specified explicitly,
there is a default implementation which requests of **Long.MAX_VALUE** which basically means "send all you have".

Neither did we see the code in the producer that takes consideration of the number of items requested by the subscriber. 

```java
Flowable.create(subscriber -> {
      log.info("Started emitting");

      for(int i=0; i < 300; i++) {
           if(subscriber.isCanceled()) {
              return;
           }
           log.info("Emitting {}", i);
           subscriber.next(i);
      }

      subscriber.complete();
}, BackpressureStrategy.BUFFER); //BackpressureStrategy will be explained further bellow
```
Looks like it's not possible to slow down production based on request(as there is no reference to the requested items),
we can at most stop production if the subscriber canceled subscription. 

This can be done if we extend Flowable so we can pass our custom Subscription type to the downstream subscriber:

```java
private class CustomRangeFlowable extends Flowable<Integer> {

        private int startFrom;
        private int count;

        CustomRangeFlowable(int startFrom, int count) {
            this.startFrom = startFrom;
            this.count = count;
        }

        @Override
        public void subscribeActual(Subscriber<? super Integer> subscriber) {
            subscriber.onSubscribe(new CustomRangeSubscription(startFrom, count, subscriber));
        }

        class CustomRangeSubscription implements Subscription {

            volatile boolean cancelled;
            boolean completed = false;
            
            private int count;
            private int currentCount;
            private int startFrom;

            private Subscriber<? super Integer> actualSubscriber;

            CustomRangeSubscription(int startFrom, int count, Subscriber<? super Integer> actualSubscriber) {
                this.count = count;
                this.startFrom = startFrom;
                this.actualSubscriber = actualSubscriber;
            }

            @Override
            public void request(long items) {
                log.info("Downstream requests {} items", items);
                for(int i=0; i < items; i++) {
                    if(cancelled || completed) {
                        return;
                    }

                    if(currentCount == count) {
                        completed = true;
                        if(cancelled) {
                            return;
                        }

                        actualSubscriber.onComplete();
                        return;
                    }

                    int emitVal = startFrom + currentCount;
                    currentCount++;
                    actualSubscriber.onNext(emitVal);
                }
            }

            @Override
            public void cancel() {
                cancelled = true;
            }
        }
    }
```   
Now lets see how we can custom control how many items we request from upstream, to simulate an initial big request, 
and then a request for other smaller batches of items as soon as the subscriber finishes and is ready for another batch.
  
```java
Flowable<Integer> flowable = new CustomRangeFlowable(5, 10);

flowable.subscribe(new Subscriber<Integer>() {

       private Subscription subscription;
       private int backlogItems;

       private final int BATCH = 2;
       private final int INITIAL_REQ = 5;

       @Override
       public void onSubscribe(Subscription subscription) {
                this.subscription = subscription;
                backlogItems = INITIAL_REQ;

                log.info("Initial request {}", backlogItems);
                subscription.request(backlogItems);
            }

            @Override
            public void onNext(Integer val) {
                log.info("Subscriber received {}", val);
                backlogItems --;

                if(backlogItems == 0) {
                    backlogItems = BATCH;
                    subscription.request(BATCH);
                }
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(Throwable throwable) {
                log.info("Subscriber encountered error");
            }

            @Override
            public void onComplete() {
                log.info("Subscriber completed");
            }
        });
=====================
Initial request 5
Downstream requests 5 items
Subscriber received 5
Subscriber received 6
Subscriber received 7
Subscriber received 8
Subscriber received 9
Downstream requests 2 items
Subscriber received 10
Subscriber received 11
Downstream requests 2 items
Subscriber received 12
Subscriber received 13
Downstream requests 2 items
Subscriber received 14
Subscriber completed        
```  

Returning to the _Flowable.create()_ example since it's not taking any account of the requested 
items by the subscriber, does it mean it might overwhelm a slow Subscriber? 

```java
private Flowable<Integer> createFlowable(int items,
                     BackpressureStrategy backpressureStrategy) {

return Flowable.create(subscriber -> {
        log.info("Started emitting");

        for (int i = 0; i < items; i++) {
            if(subscriber.isCancelled()) {
                 return;
            }
                
            log.info("Emitting {}", i);
            subscriber.onNext(i);
        }

        subscriber.onComplete();
}, backpressureStrategy); //can be BackpressureStrategy.DROP, BUFFER, LATEST,..
```
This is where the 2nd parameter _BackpressureStrategy_ comes in that allows you to specify what to do 
in the case.
 
   - BackpressureStrategy.BUFFER buffer in memory the events that overflow. Of course is we don't drop over some threshold, it might lead to OufOfMemory. 
   - BackpressureStrategy.DROP just drop the overflowing events
   - BackpressureStrategy.LATEST keep only recent event and discards previous unconsumed events.
   - BackpressureStrategy.ERROR we get an error in the subscriber immediately  
   - BackpressureStrategy.MISSING means we don't care about backpressure(we let one of the downstream operators
   onBackpressureXXX handle it -explained further down-)

  
Still what does it mean to 'overwhelm' the subscriber? 
It means to emit more items than requested by downstream subscriber.
But we said that by default the subscriber requests Long.MAX_VALUE since the code 
**flowable.subscribe(onNext(), onError, onComplete)** uses a default **onSubscribe**:
```
(subscription) -> subscription.request(Long.MAX_VALUE);
```

so unless we override it like in our custom Subscriber above, it means it would never overflow. But between the Publisher and the Subscriber you'd have a series of operators. 
When we subscribe, a Subscriber travels up through all operators to the original Publisher and some operators override 
the requested items upstream. One such operator is **observeOn**() which makes it's own request to the upstream Publisher(256 by default),
but can take a parameter to specify the request size.

```
Flowable<Integer> flowable = createFlowable(5, BackpressureStrategy.DROP)
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io(), false, 3);
flowable.subscribe((val) -> {
                               log.info("Subscriber received: {}", val);
                               Helpers.sleepMillis(millis);
                           }, logError(), logComplete());
======
[main] - Started emitting
[main] - Emitting 0
[main] - Emitting 1
[main] - Emitting 2
[main] - Emitting 3
[main] - Emitting 4
[RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] - Subscriber received: 0
[RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] - Subscriber received: 1
[RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] - Subscriber received: 2
[RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] - Subscriber got Completed event  
```
This is expected, as the subscription travels upstream through the operators to the source Flowable, while initially
the Subscriber requesting Long.MAX_VALUE from the upstream operator **observeOn**, which in turn subscribes to the source and it requests just 3 items from the source instead.
Since we used **BackpressureStrategy.DROP** all the items emitted outside the expected 3, get discarded and thus never reach our subscriber.

You may wonder what would have happened if we didn't use **observeOn**. We had to use it if we wanted to be able
to produce faster than the subscriber(it wasn't just to show a limited request operator), because we'd need a 
separate thread to produce events faster than the subscriber processes them.   

Also you can transform an Observable to Flowable by specifying a BackpressureStrategy, otherwise Observables 
just throw exception on overflowing(same as using BackpressureStrategy.DROP in Flowable.create()).
```
Flowable flowable = observable.toFlowable(BackpressureStrategy.DROP)
```
so can a hot Publisher be converted to a Flowable:
```
PublishSubject<Integer> subject = PublishSubject.create();

Flowable<Integer> flowable = subject
                .toFlowable(BackpressureStrategy.DROP)
```

There are also specialized operators to handle backpressure the onBackpressureXXX operators: **onBackpressureBuffer**,
**onBackpressureDrop**, **onBackpressureLatest**

These operators request Long.MAX_VALUE(unbounded amount) from upstream and then take it upon themselves to manage the 
requests from downstream. 
In the case of _onBackpressureBuffer_ it adds in an internal queue and send downstream the events as requested,
_onBackpressureDrop_ just discards events that are received from upstream more than requested from downstream, 
_onBackpressureLatest_ also drops emitted events excluding the last emitted event(most recent).  

```java
Flowable<Integer> flowable = createFlowable(10, BackpressureStrategy.MISSING)
                .onBackpressureBuffer(5, () -> log.info("Buffer has overflown"));

flowable = flowable
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io(), false, 3);
subscribeWithSlowSubscriber(flowable);                

=====

[main] - Emitting 0
[main] - Emitting 1
[RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] - Subscriber received: 0
[main] - Emitting 2

[main] - Emitting 9
[main] - Buffer has overflown
[RxCachedThreadScheduler-1] ERROR - Subscriber received error 'Buffer is full'                
```

We create the Flowable with _BackpressureStrategy.MISSING_ saying we don't care about backpressure
but let one of the onBackpressureXXX operators handle it.
Notice however 



Chaining together multiple onBackpressureXXX operators doesn't actually make sense
Using something like

```java
Flowable<Integer> flowable = createFlowable(10, BackpressureStrategy.MISSING)
                 .onBackpressureBuffer(5)
                 .onBackpressureDrop((val) -> log.info("Dropping {}", val))
flowable = flowable
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io(), false, 3);
                 
subscribeWithSlowSubscriber(flowable);
```

is not behaving as probably you'd expected - buffer 5 values, and then dropping overflowing events-.
Because _onBackpressureDrop_ subscribes to the previous _onBackpressureBuffer_ operator
signaling it's requesting **Long.MAX_VALUE**(unbounded amount) from it. 
Thus **onBackpressureBuffer** will never feel its subscriber is overwhelmed and never "trigger", meaning that the last 
onBackpressureXXX operator overrides the previous one if they are chained.

Of course for implementing an event dropping strategy after a full buffer, there is the special overrided
version of **onBackpressureBuffer** that takes a **BackpressureOverflowStrategy**.

```java
Flowable<Integer> flowable = createFlowable(10, BackpressureStrategy.MISSING)
                .onBackpressureBuffer(5, () -> log.info("Buffer has overflown"),
                                            BackpressureOverflowStrategy.DROP_OLDEST);

flowable = flowable
                .observeOn(Schedulers.io(), false, 3);

subscribeWithSlowSubscriber(flowable);

onBackpressureXXX operators can be added whenever necessary and it's not limited to cold publishers and we can use them 
on hot publishers also.
